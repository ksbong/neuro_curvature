# 🧠 NeuroCurvature: Geometric EEG Analysis via SNN

> **"Bridging Neural Dynamics and Complex Geometry through Spiking Neural Networks"**

This project explores a novel approach to EEG (Electroencephalogram) analysis. Instead of treating EEG as simple 1D time-series data, we map signals onto the **Complex Plane** to interpret them as geometric trajectories. By extracting **Differential Geometric** features—specifically **Curvature**—we generate bio-inspired inputs for **Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)**.

## 🚀 Core Methodology

### 1. Analytic Signal Mapping
We transform the raw real-valued EEG signal $x(t)$ into a complex analytic signal $z(t)$ using the **Hilbert Transform**. This allows us to observe the instantaneous phase and amplitude in a unified 2D space.
$$z(t) = x(t) + i\hat{x}(t) = A(t)e^{i\phi(t)}$$



### 2. Geometric Feature Extraction (Curvature)
To capture the rapid transitions in brain dynamics, we calculate the **Curvature** $\kappa$ of the trajectory in the complex plane. This metric encapsulates both phase shifts and amplitude modulations into a single geometric primitive.
$$\kappa(t) = \frac{|\dot{x}\ddot{y} - \dot{y}\ddot{x}|}{(\dot{x}^2 + \dot{y}^2)^{3/2}}$$

### 3. Spatio-temporal Spike Encoding
The extracted curvature serves as the primary driver for spike generation. By using **Latency Encoding** or **Delta Modulation**, we convert geometric "events" into discrete spikes, enabling high-efficiency inference on neuromorphic architectures.
